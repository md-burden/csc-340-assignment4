# CRUD MVC App using JPA/Hibernate, MySQL, and Thymleaf
___

## Dependencies:

For this project to work correctly, you must have the following installed:
- [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

Note: xampp can be a bit finicky due to permissions. If you have trouble quiting xampp you can make one of the following changes.

#### Automatically run as Administrator each time (Recommended)
Xampp by default does not allow unauthenticated users to have write permissions due to a potential security vulnerability. 
You could right-click and run as Administrator every time, but I find this annoying.
The following steps will ensure that  Xampp will automatically run as Administrator every time.

1. Locate your instillation for xampp. For me this is in `C:\xampp`
2. Within this directory locate `xampp-control.exe`, right click, and go to properties
3. Click on the Compatibility tab
4. Check the `Run this program as an administrator` option
5. Click apply

## Getting Started:

The first thing that you should do is start the Xampp Control Panel.
